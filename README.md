## 📖 Abstract

Text-to-image models have made significant strides in visual fidelity but often struggle with **complex spatial relationships**. Existing reward models often fail to capture these intricate spatial constraints. 

In this work, we introduce a novel method to strengthen spatial understanding in image generation:
1.  **SpatialReward-Dataset**: A curated dataset with over **80k preference pairs**, featuring adversarial spatial perturbations verified by humans.
2.  **SpatialScore**: A VLM-based reward model (built on Qwen2.5-VL) that surpasses proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.5) in spatial evaluation accuracy.
3.  **Spatial-RL**: We demonstrate that `SpatialScore` effectively enables online Reinforcement Learning (specifically GRPO with Top-k filtering), yielding significant gains in spatial generation capabilities.

## 🔥 Highlights & Contributions

### 1. SpatialReward-Dataset
We constructed a large-scale dataset focusing on spatial logic. Each entry consists of a "Perfect Image" (aligned with the text) and a "Perturbed Image" (with subtle spatial violations), creating a hard negative sample for robust training.

### 2. SpatialScore: State-of-the-Art Reward Model
By fine-tuning **Qwen2.5-VL**, our SpatialScore achieves superior performance in evaluating spatial relationships, outperforming strong baselines including HPS v2/v3, ImageReward, and even proprietary VLM APIs on our benchmarks.

| Model | Overall Accuracy |
| :--- | :---: |
| HPS v2.1 | 46.3% |
| ImageReward | 47.9% |
| GPT-5 (API) | 89.0% |
| Gemini-2.5 Pro | 95.1% |
| **SpatialScore (Ours)** | **95.8%** |

### 3. Reinforcement Learning with Top-k Filtering
We apply **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** using SpatialScore as the feedback signal. To handle reward noise and prompt difficulty variance, we introduce a **Top-k filtering strategy**, which significantly stabilizes training and improves convergence.
